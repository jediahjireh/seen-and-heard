                    At <i>Seen & Heard</i>, passion meets purpose in the fight against human-trafficking. With fierce
                    determination, we
                    aim to raise awareness, ignite change and provide support to survivors of this abhorrent crime. The
                    heart of
                    our organisation beats so that every survivor knows that they are not alone.

                OUR MISSION
            </h2>
            <p>
                Burning brightly to illuminate the darkness of human-trafficking, we are warriors of hope and committed
                to
                breaking the chains of exploitation and aiding survivor empowerment. Our mission is not a statement but
                a
                call to action from the depths of our souls - a call to find, retrieve and empower survivors.
            </p>

                For survivors

                You have a voice. You are not a victim, you are a victor.
                You are <i>Seen & Heard</i>! Resiliently reclaim
                your life and empower yourself.
            </p>

                For survivor supporters
            </h3>

            <p>
                Let's strive to educate ourselves to recognise the signs of trafficking and how we can take action
                responsibly. We need to educate our communities so that all are ready and able to provide support
                services
                to survivors of human-trafficking.
            </p>

                <p>
                    We aspire to ignite the flames of awareness that spread like wildfire, lighting up the hidden
                    corners in
                    which trafficking lurks, through various platforms to educate the public about the realities of
                    human-trafficking and how they can help prevent it, while eradicating belief in the stereotypes or
                    romanticising of this heinous crime that is traditionally portrayed through TV shows and fictional
                    novels.
                    Every voice must be heard, every life must be valued and every soul must be free.

                    Survivors have access to various resources, namely: hotlines, shelter, health care, legal aid,
                    protection,

                    open
                    arms
                    - survivors are seen and heard! Collaboration with law enforcement agencies, NGOs, essential
                    workers,
                    businesses and other contributors will allow for panoptic anti-trafficking strategies to be
                    developed.
